Cursor will develop the code for this MCP service.

Cursor will use this directory in the repo ("./cursor") to store information for itself so that it does not get lost or forget what we are doing.

Cursor will store information about decisions we made along ther way here in log files that can be referenced later by anotehr LLM or another person to understand what we did. 

Cursor will keep a log file for each day and put in that log file what we did so that when we come back later it will be available for reference.
